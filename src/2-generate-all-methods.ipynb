Systematic empiricism ________ carefully planned and recorded observations, as demonstrated by _______ that challenge stereotypes through data rather than assumptions. Empirical questions, such as gender ___________ in communication, are those that can be answered through observation, ______ value-based questions. Public knowledge is ________ through publishing research, enabling scientific progress through _____________ and self-correction, as seen in efforts like the Many Labs Replication Project. In contrast, pseudoscience lacks these principles, often failing to provide empirical evidence or ______ scrutiny, and can lead to harmful beliefs and _________.

Rationalism uses logic to draw conclusions, but _________ premises can lead to false results. Empiricism is _____ on observation and experience, yet can be deceptive due to sensory ___________.

Researchers must also _________ the population of interest, using representative samples to generalize findings. Sampling methods include simple random sampling and ___________ sampling, though the latter may not be representative. Research can be experimental, manipulating independent variables to _________ causal relationships, or non-experimental, observing variables as they naturally occur.

      "The exploration of human behavior and the natural world has fueled scientific inquiry, with psychology leveraging this curiosity to build a knowledge base grounded in research. Science aims to describe, predict, and _______ phenomena, with each goal requiring careful observation and analysis. In psychology, ____________ stem from detailed observations, such as _____________ the conditions treated by medical marijuana through patient _______. The goal of prediction uses established _____________ to forecast behaviors, like predicting pain management in medical marijuana users. Finally, ___________ seeks to uncover causal mechanisms, such as _____________ how marijuana alleviates pain, either through reducing ____________ or distress.

      "The text delves into the concept of measurement, highlighting its application across different fields, including psychology, where it is often referred to as psychometrics. ___________ involves assigning scores to individuals to represent certain _______________, which can be straightforward, like age or weight, or more complex, like _____________ constructs such as extraversion or intelligence. Constructs, not directly observable, are measured through systematic __________ and operational definitions, often involving self-report, behavioral, or _____________ measures. The text also discusses Stevens's four levels of ___________—nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio—that determine how scores are ________ and interpreted. Each level communicates varying degrees of quantitative information, guiding the ___________ procedures that can be used with the data. These levels help in making meaningful comparisons and drawing ___________ from the measured data, emphasizing the __________ of a true zero in ratio scales for making ratio-based statements.\n",

      "The text discusses various methods of acquiring knowledge, including intuition, authority, rationalism, empiricism, and the scientific method. Intuition relies on gut feelings and _________, which can be flawed due to cognitive biases. Authority ________ accepting ideas from figures like parents or the media, though history _____ such sources can be misleading. Rationalism uses logic to draw conclusions, but _________ premises can lead to false results. Empiricism is _____ on observation and experience, yet can be deceptive due to sensory ___________. The scientific method, combining rationalism and structured ____________, is the most reliable for producing valid knowledge, though it has ___________ such as resource intensity and applicability only to _________ questions.\n",

      "The STL is tasked with ensuring that employees maintain current job qualifications, using a structured process outlined in a re-qualification matrix, which depends on the duration of an employee's absence from their role. The Board of Review, known as KR-100, assesses and __________ the specific re-training requirements needed to re-establish ______________. Re-training can vary significantly; _________ absent for short periods might require minimal refreshment, while those ____ for over 18 months may need more _____________ training. Essential components of re-training include reviewing __________ updates, shadowing qualified operators, solo work, __________ assessments, and attending job-specific training. Upon fulfilling these requirements, _________ are deemed re-qualified, with all documentation ____ to the LMS Specialist for record-_______.\n",

      "Reliability and validity are key concepts in psychological measurement. Reliability refers to the ___________ of a measure, encompassing test-retest ___________, internal consistency, and inter-rater ___________. Test-retest reliability assesses the ___________ of scores over time, crucial for constructs assumed stable, like intelligence. Internal consistency _________ the correlation of responses across items within a measure, often using Cronbach’s α. Inter-rater reliability involves consistency across different observers’ _________. Validity concerns whether a measure accurately __________ the intended variable, with types including face validity, content ________, and criterion validity. Criterion validity examines ____________ with expected variables, while discriminant validity ensures scores are not __________ with distinct constructs. These concepts collectively ensure measures are both consistent and meaningful.\n",
