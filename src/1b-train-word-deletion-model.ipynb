      "One day a few years ago we had a guest of the uninvited variety. In fact, this uninvited guest was a bird--- a(n) sparrow to be more precise . \"What's that?\" I asked when I first heard the thump . \"It sounds like Joe is outside playing basketball,\" my wife, Anita, said. She paused and listened more devotedly. \"It's coming from the garage\" she said. \"Maybe it's one of the little kids \". We rushed out the door. Jonathan, our youngest, was easy to make trouble \"If he's making holes in the wall again...\" I said as I searched there. No children at all. But there was that sound again, coming from right up there. And that's when I spotted the sparrow. It was flying anxiously just inches below the ceiling. It was clearly trying to  get out  , but couldn't see that the way out wasn't up, but down and out through the open door So the bird continued beating its wings and hitting its head against the ceiling \"Poor thing,\" Anita said. \"It must be terrified\" \"Well, maybe it's because of me,\" I said as I moved toward it. I tried to show the bird how to glide down a few feet so it could get outside, but that only seemed to frighten it more. \"Why don't we just leave\" Anita suggested. \"I'm sure he'll succeed eventually.\" So we went back into the house, where we continued to hear the ongoing struggle. Then suddenly, it was silent We looked into the garage, and our uninvited guest was gone \"See?\" Anita said. \"I told you he would make it.\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"But how many knocks on the head did it cost him?\" I've thought about that little sparrow through the years. Just like that sparrow, we often meet situations we don't know how to  deal with  . Born to go upward, we don't even consider the possibility that something good might happen if we stop flapping around and just glide down a little bit.\n",

      "Christmas was coming. A lot of farmers were going to town. They hoped to sell some vegetables, fruit and meat in the market. And then they were going to buy some presents for their families. A bus came. They tried to  get on  . Robert, a strong young man, rushed in first. He occupied two seats one for his girl friend Mable and the other for himself. The bus started. Robert had a look around the bus. He saw a lot of people standing there. There were some old men among them. He hurried to  close  his eyes. Mable found it and thought he felt terrible and asked, \"What's wrong with you, dear?\"\" Nothing\"answered the kind-hearted young man. \"I can't bear to see the poor old men!\"\n"

FQOs continue training for additional roles, with records meticulously maintained. Control Room Operators (CROs) and Head Operators (HOs) undergo specialized training, including console and simulator sessions, to maintain qualifications. Requalification processes address absences, ensuring operators remain current. Interns receive supervised exposure to operations, potentially transitioning to trainees. Unit School Instructors, selected for their expertise, facilitate training. The program emphasizes continuous learning and adaptation to procedural changes, documented via electronic systems to support operator competence and advancement.'''\n",
